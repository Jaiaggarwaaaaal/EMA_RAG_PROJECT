# EMA_RAG_PROJECT

ema-assignment.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code cells is here.
<br>
ema_Assignment is the file which is directly push from the kaggle notebook

# Main_ Dependencies : 
huggingface_hub
<br>
langchain
<br>
llama_index

# overview of my work:
Used the research paper pdf as the input, used libraries, used models. 

# Failed Attempts:
this require a good amount of gpu, so shifted the model from llama 13B to 7B.
<br>
changed the accelerator many time even after changing got failed.
<br>
as having no access of openai api searched on the llamaindex documentation which LLM best suits to my requirement tried on bunch of them like replicate
<br>
sometime the issue of libraries also occur 

# result: 
i have also took some questions as prompt to check the model, the model is interactive and giving summary of conversation session after series of question and answer

# pov:
got lot to learn while building this, thanks for giving this oppurtunity and challenge
