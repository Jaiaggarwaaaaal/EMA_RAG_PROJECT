# EMA_RAG_PROJECT

ema-assignment.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook containing all the code cells is here.
<br>
ema_Assignment is the file which is directly push from the kaggle notebook

# Main_ Dependencies : 
huggingface_hub
langchain
llama_index

# overview of my work:
Used the research paper as the input, import necessary library, models. 

# fails:
this require a good amount of gpu, so shifted the model from llama 13B to 7B.
changed the accelerator many time even after changing got failed
as having no access of openai api searched on the llamaindex documentation which LLM best suits to my requirement tried on bunch of them like replicate
sometime the issue of library also occur 

# result: 
i have also took some questions as prompt to check the model, the model is interactive and give  summary of conversation session after  series of question and answer

# pov:
got lot to learn while building this, thanks for giving this oppurtunity and challenge
